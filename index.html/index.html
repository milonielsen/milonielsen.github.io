        Hey there! Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I’m currently a student in the Class of 2026 Design BFA program at Western Washington University in Bellingham.
        </p>
        <p>I’m passionate about motion design, branding, and type. I'm seeking an internship or employment opportunity where I can apply my conceptual thinking, thoughtful process, and creative problem-solving skills to agency or freelance work. I’m excited to expand my experience as a designer and love collaborating with others while working hard!
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not designing, you can find me skiing Mt. Baker pow, wandering about the wilderness, or planning my next adventure. Anyhow like basically 150 words typa stuff ya know tryna make that word count type shit, yeah man hell yeah. Anyways i'm kinda bored of coding it's hard to understand, and not the language I know and love, basically i'm in a weird spot idk, I wish this week had gone as flying smooth as it felt it was going to I want a distraction, or some sort of fulfilment to do so. 
        </p>
